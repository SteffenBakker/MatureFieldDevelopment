% The standard errors are obtained from the hessian. However, since the model estimates the parameters 
% so that the one or a couple of futures contracts are matched with close to zero measurement errors, 
% leading to that the measurement error covariance matrix (usually) is positive semi-defined.
% --> Matlab error: Warning: Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled. Results may be inaccurate.

% To be able to invert the hessian and obtain standard errors the following
% ad hoc approach can be used:
%  - Once it is known which of the future contracts is matched with close to zero measurement errors 
% the estimation can be redone with the corresponding elements in measurement error covariance matrix 
% restricted to zero and thus excluded from the estimation. In this way measurement error covariance matrix 
% is positive defined and invertible.
